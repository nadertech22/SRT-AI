This script will translate .srt files with the correct syncing using GPT 4o model from English to Arabic (you can adjust to any language accordingly)

Step-by-Step Execution Guide

Ensure Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have the OpenAI library installed.


Save the Script:
- Copy the provided script into a text editor or IDE.
- Save the file as srt_translator.py.


Prepare Your Environment:
- Open your terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where you saved srt_translator.py.


Prepare Your Input File:
- Make sure to rename the file you'd like to translate to "input.srt" and place it in the same directory as the script. Once translated the new file will appear in the same directory as well with the name "output_translated.srt"


Install Required Library:
If you havenâ€™t installed the OpenAI library, you can do so by running one of the below:
- pip3 install openai
- python3 install openai


Set Your OpenAI API Key:
- Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' in the script with your actual OpenAI API key.


In the terminal, run the script using Python:
- python3 srt_translator.py


Feel free to make any changes to the script, improve it, and contribute. This is a simple open-source project.
